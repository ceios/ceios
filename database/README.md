# Cyber-Influence-Operation-Analysis
Cyber-Influence Operation Analysis: Background, Documentation, and Modelling of Cyber and Disinformation Components.

Each documented cyber-influence operation has associated with it:
  1. A document which contains the following:
     - A brief summary of the operation
     - Resources for the information on the operation
     - Necessary contextual information and timeline of the operation. This includes identifying where tactics, techniques, and procedures are used.
     - The operation textually modelled using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework and DISARM Framework.
  2. An Attack Flow '.afb' file. Here the operation is modelled using the Attack Flow Builder
  3. The resources for the data, captured in the state found when resesarching the operation.

## The strongest examples of our database are:
  1. APT 2017 French election campaign
  2. GRU 2016 US election campaign
  3. IRA 2016 FaceMusic Malware campaign
