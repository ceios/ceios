# Matrix Visualization

This directory contains JavaScript code to render an Attack Flow on top of an ATT&CK Navigator matrix. There
is equivalent code in the Python `attack-flow` library but in order to make it more accessible for end users,
this JavaScript code is embedded in the Attack Flow website.
